# ESL_ISLR

Code for common statistical learning models featured in Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman's [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/) and Hastie, Tibshirani, James, and Witten's [Introduction to Statistical Learning in R](https://www.statlearning.com/) built from scratch in R.

All code is written simply for fun in my free time while going through the above texts and are meant only for educational/fun purposes. In most cases the processes/algorithms used are not the most stable or efficient in finite precision.

Please open an issue if you notice any errors!
