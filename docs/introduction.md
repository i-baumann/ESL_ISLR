# Introduction

This book is intended to be a collection of working examples of common statistical learning models, built as I make my way through Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman's [Elements of Statistical Learning](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/){target="_blank"} and Hastie, Tibshirani, James, and Witten's [Introduction to Statistical Learning With Applications in R](https://www.statlearning.com/){target="_blank"}.

All code is written simply for fun in my free time while going through the above texts and are meant only for educational/fun purposes. In most cases the processes/algorithms used are not the most stable or efficient in finite precision.

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/my-cabbages/ESL_ISLR/issues){target="_blank"} if you notice any errors!
